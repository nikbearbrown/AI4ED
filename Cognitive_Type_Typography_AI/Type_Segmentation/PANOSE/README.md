# PANOSE

The PANOSE System is a method for classifying typefaces solely on their visual characteristics, developed by Benjamin Bauermeister. It can be used to identify an unknown font from a sample image or to match a known font to its closest visual neighbor from a font pool.  

The PANOSE classification number consists of 10 concatenated numeric values in which a typographer classifies a type by Serif Style, Weight, Proportion, Contrast, Stroke Variation, Arm Style, Letterform, Midline, and X-height.
